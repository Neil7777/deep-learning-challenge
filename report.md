## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to create and optimize a deep learning neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict the success of funding applications for Alphabet Soup. The model aims to assist Alphabet Soup in making informed decisions on which organizations to fund, based on various features such as application type, affiliation, classification, income amount, etc.

## Results:
### Data Preprocessing:
- Target Variable(s):

	- The target variable for our model is 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', which indicates whether the funding for an organization was successful (1) or not (0).
- Feature Variable(s):

	- The features for our model include all columns except 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', as it is the target variable. Features include 'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS', 'INCOME_AMT', and 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS'.
- Variables Removed:

	- In the preprocessing steps, we removed the 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns from the input data as they are identifiers and do not contribute to the model's predictive power.
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
### Model Architecture:

- For the initial model:

	- We selected a neural network model with three layers:
		1. Input layer with 80 neurons and ReLU activation function.
		2. Hidden layer with 30 neurons and ReLU activation function.
		3. Output layer with 1 neuron and sigmoid activation function (for binary classification).
### For the optimized model:

- We increased the number of neurons and added additional hidden layers to the neural network:
		1. Input layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation function.
		2. Hidden layers with 50 and 30 neurons, both using ReLU activation functions.
		3. Output layer with 1 neuron and sigmoid activation function.
### Model Performance:

- Initial Model:

	- Loss: 0.5593
	- Accuracy: 72.52%
- Optimized Model:

	- Loss: 0.5801
	- Accuracy: 73.11%
### Target Model Performance:

- While the optimized model achieved an accuracy of 73.11%, it did not reach the target model performance of 75%.
### Steps Taken to Improve Model Performance:

- For the optimization, we adjusted the model architecture by adding more neurons and hidden layers.
- We also preprocessed the data by binning rare occurrences in APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION.
- Additionally, we increased the number of training epochs to 150.
## Summary:
Overall, the deep learning model showed moderate performance with an accuracy of 73.11% after optimization. While it did not meet the target accuracy of 75%, it still provides valuable insights into predicting the success of funding applications for Alphabet Soup.
